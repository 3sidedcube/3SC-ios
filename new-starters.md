# New Starters

Welcome to 3 Sided Cube ðŸ‘‹. It's great to have you on board with us!

## Your Toolkit

Standard tools for iOS we recommend getting set up with include:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and command line tools (Get from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835))
* Various [Developer tools](#developer-tools)
* (Optional) Git GUI like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* (Optional) Merge conflict editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* (Optional) [Figma](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) desktop app for designs

### Developer Tools

Firstly, make sure to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Using Homebrew you can install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control (`brew install git`)
* [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for linting in Swift (`brew install swiftlint`)
* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for building binary frameworks (`brew install carthage`)

## Bitbucket SSH Keys

Please follow this [Atlassian SSH Keys Guide](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/) carefully to ensure your Git client can authenticate with Bitbucket.

## Github SSH Keys

Similarly to Bitbucket, SSH keys need to be aded for Github as a lot of our iOS frameworks are hosted there. Please see the [Github SSH Keys Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

## Branching Model

We use the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model to organise our branches.
Though it has now been marked as "legacy", the model continues to fit well with our production process.

## Pull Requests

Please see the 3 Sided Cube Confluence page documenting a [Pull Request Template](https://3sidedcube.atlassian.net/l/cp/znE3vJNA).

## Swift Style Guide

Please make sure to familiarise yourself with the following Swift style guides:

* [Swift API Design Guideline](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/), and other similar articles that Apple publish
* [Ray Winderlich Style Guide](https://github.com/kodecocodes/swift-style-guide)

This enables us to write the best quality code we can.
